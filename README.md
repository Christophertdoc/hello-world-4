# ReactJS Hello World

A bare bones starter environment/app for React with Babel and Webpack.

Created from the video tutorial "React Fundamentals: Development Environment Setup" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BHoz0ptv7k

Deviations from original tutorial video include:
  1. In "webpack.config.js", the path was changed to "/" in place of "./"
  2. In "webpack.config.js", the loader was changed to "babel-loader" in place of "babel".
